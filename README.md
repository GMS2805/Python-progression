# Python-progression
Practice and progress tracking of python skills

Establishing use of Python through consistent practice.  
Focus areas include core syntax, data structures, and basic problem-solving.  
Eventual priorities will be towards handling data, plotting and tasks related to academic and industrial research.
Work will be tracked through Jupyter notebooks in this repository.

** Repo Started:** 9 Dec 2025  
**Current goal:** Establish routine proficiency in Python basics.

PS I use the openstax book, "Introduction to python programming" as the base learning material for my python learning.
It can be found at https://openstax.org/details/books/introduction-python-programming
The content of my notebook uploads contains - notes while learning, points to remember, examples, exercises as guided by the book.
