# Python-progression
Practice and progress tracking of python skills

In this repo, work is tracked in the form of Jupyter notebooks related to various topics.
Each notebook will contain a mix of - notes while learning, points to remember, examples, exercises.

I use the openstax book, "Introduction to python programming" as the base learning material for my python learning.
It can be found at https://openstax.org/details/books/introduction-python-programming

** Repo Started:** 9 Dec 2025  
**Current goal:** Establish routine proficiency in Python basics.
Eventual priorities will be towards handling data, plotting and tasks related to academic and industrial research.
